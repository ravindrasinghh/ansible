Ansible work on ssh keyless Password Authentication

1.setup the 3 machine
2.created the user with anme test and password test in all 3 machine with password test
3.Changes the file /etc/ssh/sshd_config
*Enable the permit root login
*Enable the Password Authenticatioin
4.After changes in SSHD_Config
5.Type Command systemctl restart sshd
6.try login with ssh test@ipaddress
7exit
(Because while coming to sudo  it ask for PAssword)
8.connect ec2 instancce with pem file and test user to sudoer file to give root priviliedges
ec2-user        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
test            ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
9.Now type command su - test 2 swtch user without entering password
10.Type sudo fdisk -l tio check user have permission or not.

11.Now we have to generate key
commands
a.ssh-keygen across the 3 nodes.
b.copy the ssh key to across 3 nodes.
ssh-copy-id test@ipaddress1(master)	
ssh-copy-id test@ipaddress2(node)
ssh-copy-id test@ipaddress3(node)
one way directional
x`
c.now fire the command ssh-copy-id from node to master to accesss,
ssh-copy-id test@ipaddress1(master)
ssh-copy-id test@ipaddress2(node)
ssh-copy-id test@ipaddress3(node)


***
configure ansible using   EPEL(Extra PAckage Redhat package mgmt.)
EPEL should be install on machine

1.sudo yum update
2.sudo yum install ansible 
ansible --version

to add agent(node) in /etc/ansible/hosts
add ip in EX1.
configuration file of ansible /etc/ansible.ansible.conf
enble this to get log of ansible (log_path = /var/log/ansible.log)


Agent is successfully added or not
TYPE:ansible -m ping all
ANSIBLE SUCCESSFULLY INSTALLED
